# Boost Your Instagram Followers

Welcome to the Boost Your Instagram Followers Phishing platform! This project contains the source code for a simple web application that allows users to increase their Instagram followers. The application is comprised of an HTML frontend and a PHP backend to process user login and follower increase requests.

## Files in the Repository

- `index.html`: The main webpage that users interact with.
- `process.php`: The backend script that handles form submissions and processes the login credentials.

## Features

- **User Login**: Users can securely log in to their Instagram accounts.
- **Follower Increase**: Users can select the number of followers they want to increase.
- **Popup Notification**: A popup message informs users to wait for 30 minutes while their request is being processed.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/technicalcorp0/Instagram_Phishing
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd boost-instagram-followers
   ```

3. **Upload the files to your web server**:
   Ensure that both `index.html` and `process.php` are in the same directory on your web server.

4. **Set file permissions**:
   Ensure that the server has write permissions to create files in the directory where `process.php` is located.

## How It Works

1. **Login to Your Instagram Account**:
   Users enter their Instagram username and password in the form provided.

2. **Select Number of Followers**:
   Users choose the desired number of followers they want to add to their account.

3. **Click "Go"**:
   Upon clicking the "Go" button, the form is submitted, and the user is notified via a popup message to wait for 30 minutes while the request is processed.

4. **Processing**:
   The `process.php` script handles the backend processing and stores the login credentials in a file (for demonstration purposes only).
